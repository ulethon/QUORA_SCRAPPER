         original_msg :  On You tube, short of getting into those with intelligence game like controls, there are some really great ways hackers have been able to reverse the role of the scammer. A scammer tries to worm their way into the user’s pc and when doing so and getting into the banking screens, after checking how much money is available the scammer presses “send” money. It is too late, the money is transferred. However, these particular types of hackers turn it around and end up making money from the scammer. Eon Musk had made a statement regarding some threat from the Kremlin. Musk sprayed them with “It’s like when a missile is launched and it returns to its place of origin.” Cyber war games end up “walking thru back alleys,” were only the brave tread. The stakes are awesome, and most of us can’t deal with the consequences for these types of heroes, mostly “thankless” operating in the dark shadows of the government. Security firms with clearances dependent upon need and other criteria may find that utilities, grid, and so on are vulnerable and some hot shot hacker is trying to shot and whammo, presses the button on the game handle before the scammer pressed the “send’ button. ,

         original_msg :  In the realm of cybersecurity, the concept of self-defense is somewhat different from physical self-defense situations. While there isn't a direct equivalent of a \ self-defense cyber attack\  in the traditional sense, there are measures and practices that organizations and individuals can employ to defend themselves against cyber threats. Let me explain a few key concepts: Cybersecurity Defense: This involves implementing various security measures to protect computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. It includes deploying firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, encryption, access controls, and other defensive mechanisms. Incident Response: When a cyber threat or attack occurs, organizations often have incident response plans in place to minimize the damage and quickly recover from the incident. Incident response teams investigate the attack, mitigate its effects, and work on preventing future incidents. Threat Intelligence: Organizations and security professionals actively monitor the cyber threat landscape to stay informed about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack techniques. By gathering and analyzing threat
